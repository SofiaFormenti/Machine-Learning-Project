# Final project for my Machine Learning course! ðŸŽ¯Â 
<br/>
 In this project my aim was to predict medical cost prediction based on various features. <br/>
 
 ___

The main libraries used in the project are: <br/><br/>
:round_pushpin:Matplotlib and Seaborn <br/>
:round_pushpin:Numpy and Pandas <br/>
:round_pushpin:Sklearn <br/>
***
<br/>
The project entails:<br/>

<br/>

- Data visualization <br/>
>  histogram, density plot, correlation matrix, scatter plot, etc.<br/>
- Preprocessing <br/>
> Missing data imputation (this dataset is completely clean, some noise was created for practice)<br/>
> Scaling<br/>
- Train test split<br/>
- Regression Pipeline<br/>
- Error imputation<br/>
> MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2<br/>
- Hyperparameter tuning<br/>
> Dimensionality reduction (PCA,LDA, Kbest), regressor model(LR, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Kneighbours)<br/>
> Cross validation<br/>
- Best model selection<br/>
- Best model tuning (Random Forest made it to the top!ðŸŒ³)<br/>
- Learning and validation curves plotting<br/>
<br/>

Bonus: Neural Modelâœ¨<br/>
<br/>
I implemented a simple sequential neural model with tensorflow to compare the results
